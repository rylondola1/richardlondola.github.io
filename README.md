My GitHub account, 'rylondola1', is primarily focused on software development projects, including web applications and data analysis tools.
I created a repository named 'richardlondola.github,io' on GitHub to do my lab assignements.
I used the desktop version to clone my repository to my local machine, I selected the repository that I needed to clone then I press the "clone this repository" button to the right bottom corner. After that I selected the location that I needed the clone to be saved in my machine.
